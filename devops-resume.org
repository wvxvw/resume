* Work History
  
** PowToon Ltd.
   + Position :: /Programmer/ / /ops/
   + Term :: /January 2014--May 2015/
   + *Accomplishments*
     - I set up and maintained Jenkins continuous integration server in
       an AWS box.  Maintainance included writing non-trivial configuration
       files, patching plug-ins (the mailer plugin), and one major version
       upgrade.
     - I wrote most of the infrastructure code s.a. build scripts, automated
       test generation and simplistic statistical analysis.  This included
       Ant build scripts for the ActionScript part of the project.  Gradle
       scripts for managing back-office resources.  Python (Fabric) scripts
       for deployment of the server-side and some statistics extraction
       from the customers database (NumPy, SciPy), although the later was
       more of an experiment.
     - I wrote several designs for the product.
   
** TransGaming Inc.
   + Position :: /Programmer/ / /ops/
   + Term :: /April 2013--2013 (less than a year)/
   + *Accomplishments*
     - I wrote a tester program, which stress-tested the program performance
       on ``Smart TV''.
     - I wrote automated build for my project.
     - I wrote a sizable chunk of code dealing with usage statistic aggregation
       using Google Analytics.
     - I did a good deal of administrative work on company's Git repository.
       This included working with history, cleaning the repository up, exporting
       reports, managing users' permissions, writing hooks.

** Rounds
   + Position :: /Programmer/
   + Term :: /December 2010 â€“ August 2011 (9 months)/
   + *Accomplishments*
     - I wrote a testing server and utility programs for automated testing.
     - I wrote a small natural language processing program which was used
       to advertise the company's product.
     - For a short while I managed company's bug tracking system (Trac),
       later replaced by Redmine, and then outsourced.
   
* Courses
  - I am a second year student in Open University of Israel, facutly of
    Mathematics.
  - I also took some on-line courses, s.a. Data Scientists Toolbox, Statistics,
    Data Analysis, Machine Learning. at Coursera and edX.

* Books
  This section lists some books, which, in my view, may help explain what kind
  of knowledge I have in relevant fields.
  
  - agile programming :: Extreme Programming Explained by Kent Beck.
  - software architecture :: Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture by
       Martin Fowler.
  - development and operations :: Pro Puppet by Spencer Krum, William Van
       Hevelingen, Ben Kero, James Turnbull, Jeffrey McCune.
  - general computer science :: SICP, AITMA, TAOCP.  Less commonplace ones:
       Types and Programming Languages by B. C. Pierce, Homotopy Type Theory:
       Univalent Foundations of Mathematics, A Structural Approach to
       Operational Semantics by G. D. Plotkin--just to give you a sense of what
       I'm interested in.
  - I regularly read CS periodicals, attend on-line lectures and listen to
    podcasts with particular interest in AI and computational linguistics.

* Volunteering And Community Work
  SCons project, ActionScript plugin.  (SCons is an extensible build system
  written in Python).

  For several years I was a member of Adobe Community Board.  I moderated a
  forum dedicated to Flash and ActionScript.

  I'm an active member of Emacs Q/A site from the StackExchange family.
