** Other Jobs
   - HP (Hewlett Packard) :: I worked for almost a year in HP office in Yehud.
        during this time I worked on a Flex front-end for a large accounting
        application.  I also wrote some Java code related to client-server
        communication.
   - Mishloha :: I worked there very briefly.  The company was hoping to transition
        their old infrastructure written in ASP Classic (both VB and JScript) to
        Ruby on Rails, but they gave up their project.  They also had a sizable
        amount of code written in PHP.  My job there mostly included a failed
        attempt at cleaning up the layers of cruft left by bygone developers.

* Frequently Asked Questions
  + Q :: Am I familiar with web stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)?
  + A :: Yes, but I prefer to do something else for living.

  + Q :: Most of my experience indicates I worked on client side, why do I want
       to switch to development and operations or Python?
  + A :: Client-side development, historically, was always left to the armature
       programmers.  It uses technologies which don't require any skill or
       knowledge on the part of the programmer.  On top of it, the programs are
       not judged by their programming merits, but mostly rely on the subjective
       ``feeling'', based primarily on the work of the graphic designer.

  + Q :: How many programming languages do I know? Please give us a list.
  + A :: I certainly know more than you do.  An exhaustive list would bore you
       to death with the names you don't know how to read.  It's easier to
       tell which languages I consciously tried to avoid.
    - I don't like C++.  It's an over-marketed very poorly designed language.
    - I will not write in C#, because writing in C# implies working on MS Windows,
      and that's just immoral.  I've sinned enough already, I'm not looking to
      cooperate with more corrupt enterprises on top of it.  The argument,
      of course, extends to the entire .NET platform as well as Obj-C, and other
      such monsters.
    - I don't know Pascal.  Everyone since the don of the programming era seems
      to be happy writing pseudo-code in broken likelihood of Pascal.  This is
      something I can't stand about this language.  Use FORTRAN, motherlovers,
      be authentic!

  + Q :: Do I have any Linux experience?
  + A :: The answer should be obvious by now, but if it isn't, then here it is:
       Yes.

  + Q :: Do I know any SQL?
  + A :: Yes I do.

  + Q :: And NoSQL?
  + A :: Yes, quite a lot, actually.

* Courses
  I took several online courses from Coursera, Udacity and edX, which required
  me to complete programming assignments in Python.

  I took a complete series of courses in statistics at edX (three courses),
  the data scientist toolbox course at Coursera (six short courses), machine
  learning at Udacity, introduction to algorithms (two courses) at Coursera.

  I also volunteered for SCons project, writing an ActionScript plugin for it.
  (SCons is an extensible build system written in Python).

  Two years ago I interviewed for a position of Python programmer at Walla.
  They requested that I write a small test project, which I did.  The project,
  although somewhat outdated, is still available for viewing:
  https://github.com/wvxvw/intj.

  I am currently studying in Open University of Israel, mathematics faculty,
  about to finish my first year.

* Hobbies
  - NLP
  - Computational linguistics
  - Moral philosophy
  - General AI
  - Graphs
