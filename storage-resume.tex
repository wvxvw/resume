\section*{Technology Skills}
\label{sec:org6fc0f09}
The company I currently work for: Replix.IO, develops a storage
product, specifically, a long-distance online zero-RTO (Recovery
Time Objective) replication software.  While we plan to expand to
object store and, perhaps, replication of popular databases, at
present, the product works with block device level storage.  The
product is designed to be used on public cloud, however, there's a
plan to extend the service to on-premise installations.  Given this
background, my expertise is in the cloud storage, using Linux
together with some popular related technologies and products
s.a. Docker, SPDK, Consul, Prometheus etc.

The product itself is written in Rust, but automation code is almost
entirely written in Python.  Automation code needs to interface with
tools like Terraform on one hand and the typical development stack
s.a. Git, JIRA, Gitlab etc.

Automation tools rely on ZMQ for communication, Behave for test
harness.  We've developed a test deployment tool in-house to extends
Wheel format for Python packages in order to deploy the tests.  We
are now experimenting with property-based testing and fuzzing.

We use some third-party testing tools s.a. SysBench and DBT2 in our
tests as well as a lot of usual Linux tooling, like FIO, SAR, and
tools that come with popular storage products like \texttt{pgbench} and
\texttt{cassandra-stress}.

\subsection*{Previous experience}
\label{sec:org4954efe}
Before working for Replix.IO, I worked with another storage
product: Elastifile distributed file system (created by
Elastifile).  I worked on a large infrastructure project mostly
written in Go, which used some popular third-party tools for
testing, FIO, FSF2008, FSF2012, VDBench among others.  Since this
was before Docker Swarm, while Kubernetes was in its infancy, a lot
of infrastructure code was dedicated to container management.

Another part of this project was about integration with VMWare's
VCenter, which was considered the primary target for the product.

\subsection*{Non-work-related (programming) skills}
\label{sec:orgf41e480}
I like Lisp and Prolog.  I have decent knowledge of Common Lisp.
I'm very enthusiastic about Mercury.  I know Emacs Lisp fairly
well.  I help my wife with statistical programming in Python using
Pandas, Pill and other popular data-science software.
