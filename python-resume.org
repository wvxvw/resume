* Foreword
  After sending my complete resume couple dozens times I've came to conclusion
  that if I mention all programming-related experience I had so far, this
  confuses human resources employees, therefore this version of my resume
  will focus on my experience related to Python and will deliberately leave
  out the rest.

  I will, however, put a loundry list of technologies I worked with here in
  order to optimize the search.

  + GNU/Linux :: is the operating system I use at work and at home.  Most of
       the time it's RHEL-like distros, but I'm also familiar with Debian-style
       infrastructure.  I know enough to perform a system administrator function,
       however I'm not actively seeking that role.
  + Web stack :: which includes HTML, JavaScript and CSS.  I've used all of
       these on more than one occasion.  In fact, my programming career began
       with another ECMAScript dialect - ActionScript.  I'm familiar with
       many JavaScript implementations, including NodeJS, Rhino and even
       Qt Script.  I'm familiar with NodeJS because it is used with tools
       like =jslint=, =tern= and =Grunt= for JavaScript development tasks.
       I'm familiar with Rhino because it is used in testing in Selenium
       and because it is available in Ant scripts, while it doesn't require
       additional libraries, which makes it a choice of embedded programming
       language in it.  I was considering Qt Script for one of my pet projects,
       which, unfortunately, never left the ground.
       If I need to throw in some names, then, of course, I used JQuery, 
       I also used Backbone before everyone was so excited about Angluar,
       I also used Prototype before everyone was so excited about Backbone.
       Of course I know and used Underscore, various JQuery plugins, Mootools,
       and a lot of other species from the JavaScrip zoo.
       Eventually, I also touched PHP, JSP and even ASP (classic!) both the
       Basic and the JScript varieties, but washing the smell off my hands
       was no easy taks.

* Work History
  
** PowToon Ltd.
   + *Position:* /Programmer/
   + *Term:* /January 2014--May 2015/

   When the company hired me, they didn't have any automated builds and no tests
   for their product.  Even though it wasn't my direct responsibility, I
   volunteered to write build scripts, which included using Fabric, Ant and
   Gradle.  I also volunteered to set up Jenkins continuous integration server
   which I later managed until I quit.

   I also tried to organize testing, however, I had only achieved partial success
   here.  I wrote a minimal HTTP server based on =SimpleHTTPServer= with HTML
   interface for developers, and (later) testers, where they could submit bug
   reports, which would be automatically converted into test cases.  Regardless
   of the system being very simple, other programmers avoided using it.

   During my time at Powtoon I also conducted several experiments in statistical
   analysis (albeit very simplistic) of the data collected by the company.
   In particular, using =NumPy= and =SciPy= packages I wrote a simple /k-means/
   algorithm which would try to cluster the textual data extracted from the
   presentations prepared by the users based on the presentation's subject.

   Powtoon's server-side code is written using Django framework, obviously,
   I had to use it too.
   
** TransGaming Inc.
   + *Position:* /Programmer/
   + *Term:* /April 2013--2013 (less than a year)/

   A very cumbersome part of my job here was the testing.  The company
   specializes in games for the so-called ``smart-TV''.  This implies working
   with proprietary products which make it difficult to test integration due to
   restrictions wrt viewing the source code and communication protocols.

   In order to automate the testing, I used Selenium server, which I extended
   with my code intended to automate deployment into television set or an
   emulator.  My job, however, had an interesting side to it too: since my
   primary objective was to write a game, in order to test the game, I wrote
   several game bots, with different skill level.
   
** Rounds
   + *Position:* /Programmer/
   + *Term:* /December 2010 â€“ August 2011 (9 months)/

   Before the company hired me, the company never conducted any systematic
   testing of their product.  Even though testing was not on the list of my
   direct responsibilities, I volunteered to write a minimal testing server
   which would replicate the API of the company's main server and I wrote a chat
   client (the company's product is a video chat), which would enact prepared
   scenarios in order to search for misalignment in the chat protocol
   interpretation on the client and server sides.
   
* Courses
  I took several online courses from Coursera, Udacity and edX, which required
  me to complete programming assignments in Python.

  I took a complete series of courses in statistics at edX (three courses),
  the data scientist toolbox course at Coursera (six short courses), machine
  learning at Udacity, introduction to algorithms (two courses) at Coursera.

  I also volunteered for SCons project, writing an ActionScript plugin for it.
  (SCons is an extensible build system written in Python).

  Two years ago I interviewed for a position of Python programmer at Walla.
  They requested that I write a small test project, which I did.  The project,
  although somewhat outdated, is still available for viewing:
  https://github.com/wvxvw/intj.

  I am currently studying in Open University of Israel, mathematics faculty,
  about to finish my first year.

* Hobbies
  - NLP
  - Computational linguistics
  - Moral philosophy
  - General AI
  - Graphs
