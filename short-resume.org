* Foreword
  Even though most of my recorded experience is in Flash and associated
  technologies, I am now looking to continue in a different field.  Being an
  Emacs user, my preferences of language, operating system and general attitude
  towards my trade have grown to be very different from those typical of the
  Flash community.  The closest thing I can possibly hope to find on the jobs
  market would be a Python programmer position, with a very strong preference
  towards Linux as a working environment.
